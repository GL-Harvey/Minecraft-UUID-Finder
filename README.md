An UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) finder script for Minecraft is a program that allows players to search for the unique identifier assigned to each player account.
The script takes the player's username as input and returns their UUID, which can be used for various purposes in the game such as adding players to a whitelist or creating custom skins.
The script can be written in a variety of programming languages, but the core functionality remains the same.
To describe the script, it is a tool that helps players to find their unique identifier in Minecraft, using their username as the input.
